# -JDBC-Console-CRUD-Operations
Create a Java console application that demonstrates JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) integration with a relational database for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project will help you understand how to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, and manage data through a simple console interface.
**Features:**

Database Connection:
Implement a JDBC connection to a relational database (MySQL).
Set up the necessary configuration for the database connection, such as URL, username, and password.
Table Creation:
Design a table schema for the application (e.g., User table with fields like ID, Name, Email, etc.).
Create the table using SQL statements within the application.
CRUD Operations:
Create (Insert):
Allow users to input data through the console.
Insert the data into the database using JDBC.
Read (Select):
Fetch and display data from the database.
Implement options for displaying all records or a specific record based on user input.
Update:
Enable users to update existing records.
Prompt users to input the new values and update the corresponding database records.
Delete:
Implement the functionality to delete records based on user input.
Provide options to delete a specific record or all records.
Exception Handling:
Implement proper exception handling to manage database-related errors gracefully.
Display informative messages to users in case of any issues.
